Pipeline description

Artificial data, 25 sets
1. Generate artificial 25 sets (generate_artificial_sets.py)
2. Run DCAE on art set (run_DCAE_on_25_ART_sets.py)
3. Generate UMAP and SAUCIE for ART sets (generate_UMAP_and_SAUCIE_for_ART_sets.py)
4. Performance evaluation
  a. Compute 'Borealis' performance measures (discontinuity, manytoone) (Performance_Borealis.py)
  b. Compute 'MSS' and 'LSSS' performance measures  (Performance_MSS_LSSS.py)
  c. Compute topological performance (Performance_toplology.py)
  d. Illustration for topological measures (Performance_measure_demo_plots_sim_data_normalized.py)
5. Sensitivity analysis (DCAE_sensitivity.py)


Real data, 3 sets
1. Run DCAE on real sets set (run_DCAE_on_real_sets.py)
3. Generate UMAP and SAUCIE for real sets (generate_UMAP_and_SAUCIE_for_REAL_sets.py)
4. Performance evaluation
  a. Compute 'Borealis' performance measures (discontinuity, manytoone) (Performance_Borealis_real_sets.py)
  b. Compute 'MSS' and 'LSSS' performance measures  (Performance_MSS_LSSS_real_sets.py)
5. Tuning the models (to be added)
